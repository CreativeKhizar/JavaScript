// use strict helps us in not making mistakes.

"use strict";

// intro to variables

// Variables can store some information
// we can use that information later
// we can change that information later
// variable names are case Sensitive

// declare a variable we use var keyword
// If we don't use var then also program runs but
// it is not a good programming practice.

var firstName = "Harshit";

// use a variable

console.log(firstName);

// change value

// if we use var again then two variables are created.

firstName = "Mohit";

console.log(firstName);
