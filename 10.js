// template String

let age=22;
let firstName = "harshit";

// "my name is harshith and my age is 22 "
let aboutMe = "my name is "+firstName+" and my age is "+age;
console.log(aboutMe);

// Another way by using template string

let aboutMe2 = `my name is ${firstName} and my age is ${age}`;
console.log(aboutMe2);
