History of JavaScript :-
-----------------------

1. In 1995 a popular web browser Netscape Navigator, they wanted a programming language
to add interacting in website

2. Brenden Erich made javascript from 1995 in 10 days first name mocha and then Live JavaScript
then for marketing they made javascript.

3. Then Internet Explorer took javascript and made changes and made JavaScript

4. In 1996 there are two languages JavaScript and JScript. Here javascript for netscape 
and JScript for Internet Explorer

5. Then JavaScript is taken Ecma Script that Standardize Technologies,

6. Then JavaScript made as ECMAScript

7. In 1997 ES1 came that every browser should follow, then ES2, ES3 and in ES5
    (2009) that bought many new features, ES6(2015) Biggest Update in the history of JScript

8. ES6 is referred as Modern JavaScript 

9. Members of tc39 decides what new features should be given in JavaScript.

10. ES7, ES8 came.

11. JavaScript is Backward Comaptible but JavaScript is not forward compatible.

12. Babel is used to transpile the code for Forward compatibility.

1. Download Vs Code from official website.

Note:-

1. To print a log message 
        console.log("message")

2. Double quotes or single quotes both are valid

used in String templates.

4. Semicolon is optional but it is a good 
programming practice.

Primitives:

How Primitives are stored
----------------------------

Primitives are stored in stacks.

var4
var3
var2
var1

Ex:

let num1=4;
let num2=num1;

This is how it looks in stack
4   num2
4   num1

If one value changes then other variable
values doesn't get reflected.

How Reference Types are stored:
---------------------------------

There are two areas in Memory
1. Stack (Primitives)
2. Reference (Heap)

let array1=["item1","item2"]
let array2=array1;
array1                      array2
        \                 /
         ["item1","item2"]

If one variable value changes then all
reference variable values changes.

Note:-
________
Here array1, array2 are pointers that are
stored in Stack that contains address of
the Heap Memory Area.

array1 -> 0X11
array2 -> 0X11

When you push item3 then

array1                              array2
        \                       /
         ["item1","item2","item"]

Both array1,array2 has same address.

Best Way to Clone is Slice as 
it is best in Performance

Mostly used is spread.

Use all the Reference types with const 
keyword.

Objects are stored in Memory similar to
Arrays.
